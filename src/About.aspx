        There is more to housing affordability than how much rent or mortgage you pay. Transportation costs are the second-biggest budget item for most families, but to date there hasn't been an easy way for people to fully factor transportation costs into decisions about where to live and work. The goal of the Location Affordability Portal is to provide the public with reliable, user-friendly data and resources on combined housing and transportation costs to help consumers, policymakers, and developers make more informed decisions about where to live, work, and invest.
        <br /><br />
        The Portal features two new cutting-edge tools — the <a href="lai.aspx">Location Affordability Index</a> and <a href="tcc.aspx">My Transportation Cost Calculator</a>—that illustrate from different perspectives how housing and transportation costs impact affordability. In addition to these decision-support tools, the Portal provides access to supporting resources that offer a wide range of information on current research and practice aimed at understanding, and ultimately reducing, the combined housing and transportation cost burden borne by American families.
        <br /><br />
        HUD and DOT are committed to engaging with the public to continually improve and expand this resource. Please email <a href="mailto:locationaffordability@hud.gov">locationaffordability@hud.gov</a> with any questions or comments.

        <p class="testimonial">"The costs of transportation now approach or exceed those of housing for many working families, yet federal definitions of housing affordability fail to recognize their interdependence… This index will serve to make transparent the costs of living in a given location, and inform consumers and businesses about their choices in real-time, so they can make intelligent decisions about how to combine transportation and housing choices to lower their cost burdens."</p>
