                There is more to housing affordability than how much rent or mortgage you pay. Transportation costs are 
                the second-biggest budget item for most families, but it can be difficult for people to fully factor 
                transportation costs into decisions about where to live and work. The Location Affordability Index (LAI) 
                is user-friendly source of standardized data on combined housing and transportation costs to help consumers, 
                policymakers, and developers make more informed decisions about where to live, work, and invest.

                The Portal features two new cutting-edge tools — the <a href="lai.aspx">Location Affordability Index</a> and 
                <a href="tcc.aspx">My Transportation Cost Calculator</a>—that illustrate from different perspectives how 
                housing and transportation costs impact affordability. In addition to these decision-support tools, the Portal 
                provides access to supporting resources that offer a wide range of information on current research and practice 
                aimed at understanding, and ultimately reducing, the combined housing and transportation cost burden borne by 
                American families.

                <strong>Note on recent changes</strong>. Due to resource constraints, HUD is no longer able to support the 
                two data apps formerly available on this site: the map-driven Location Affordability Index app and My 
                Transportation Cost Calculator. HUD will continue to update the LAI on an annual basis, which will allow 
                interested policymakers, researchers, and web developers to use current data for new research and other 
                applications going forward.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="aboutsection">
                    The Location Affordability Portal is the product of a collaboration between HUD and the Department of 
                    Transportation (DOT) under the federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities. The Partnership, which 
                    includes the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Transportation, and the 
                    Environmental Protection Agency, works to coordinate federal housing, transportation, water, and other 
                    infrastructure investments to make neighborhoods more prosperous, allow people to live closer to jobs, 
                    save households time and money, and reduce pollution. One objective of this collaboration is to increase 
                    public access to data on housing, transportation, and land use. EPA's Smart Location Database and 
                    <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen" target="_blank">EJSCREEN</a> tools and HUD’s 
                    forthcoming <a href="https://egis.hud.gov/Affht/" target="_blank">AFFH Data Tool</a> are other resources 
                    developed for this purpose.

                <p class="aboutsection">
                    The prevailing standard of affordability in the United States is paying 30 percent or less of your family’s 
                    income on housing, which fails to account for for transportation costs. One reason is that transportation costs 
                    are a much bigger factor now than in the past. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the 1930's 
                    American households spent just 8 percent of their income on transportation. Since then, as millions of 
                    families  have migrated from center cities to surrounding suburbs and exurbs and come to rely more heavily 
                    on cars, that percentage has steadily increased, peaking at 19.1 percent in 2003. Today, households spend 
                    on average about 17 percent of their annual income on transportation, second only to housing costs in terms 
                    of budget impact. And for many-working class and rural households, transportation costs actually exceed 
                    housing costs.

                    Before this Portal, though, there was no accurate, standardized data source on household transportation 
                    expenses, which limited the ability of homebuyers and renters to fully account for the cost of living in a 
                    particular city or neighborhood. This site seeks to fill that gap.

                    Planners, policymakers, and developers also stand to benefit from access to this data when making decisions 
                    about land use, housing, transportation, and economic development. HUD and DOT have  engaged experts and key 
                    stakeholders from the fields of urban and transportation planning, affordable housing, and economic development 
                    and produced extensive reviews of the data and modeling techniques used in the tools that have been made 
                    available on this site for the first time.
